                        <p>The total debt-to-GDP ratio decreased significantly under Aquino's fiscal restraint, going from 52% in 2010 to 45% in 2015. The retirement of some external debt allowed for a reduction in total debt, which helped the nation maintain strong macroeconomic fundamentals and an investment-grade credit rating.</p>
                        <p>Then, Duterte took over from Aquino with a comparatively low debt-to-GDP ratio that, as of the end of 2016, was 42.1%. To finance its ambitious infrastructure program and other expenditure goals, the Duterte administration has expanded the government's borrowing. The nation's debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 60.4% by the end of 2020, with estimates by the Department of Finance stating the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 60.9%. In reality, it reached up to 63.7% by November 2022.</p>

                        <p>Debt growth has aided in funding the construction of infrastructure, which will hopefully spur employment growth and economic expansion. Nonetheless, there are worries regarding the sustainability of the nation's mounting debt, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic's uncertainty and its effects on the country's budgetary situation.</p>
                        <p>Economically speaking, the rise in debt has resulted in increased interest payments, which could strain the government's budget and deplete funds for other spending priorities like social services and poverty eradication. Moreover, a larger debt-to-GDP ratio can make the nation more susceptible to outside shocks and restrict the government's ability to deal with crises.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, even while the Duterte administration's increased borrowing has aided in funding much needed infrastructure development, it is crucial that the government strike a balance between this and fiscal sustainability in order to guarantee that debt is sustainable in the long run.</p>
